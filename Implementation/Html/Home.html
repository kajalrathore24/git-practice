                <h1>Who discovered bulb??</h1>
                <p>The story of the lightbulb begins long before Edison patented the first commercially successful bulb in 1879. In 1800, Italian inventor Alessandro Volta developed the first practical method of generating electricity, the voltaic pile. Made of alternating discs of zinc and copper — interspersed with layers of cardboard soaked in salt water — the pile conducted electricity when a copper wire was connected at either end. Volta's glowing copper wire is officially considered a precursor to the battery, but is also one of the earliest manifestations of incandescent lighting.</p>

                The worlds longest lasting light bulb has been used for over a century
    The aptly named Centennial Light at the Livermore/Pleasanton Fire Department in California is the world longest lasting incandescent bulb. The bulb has been in use since 1901, meaning that as of 2021, the bulb has surpassed its initial title and has been burning for 120 years! The bulb is almost never switched off, and does not possess its original functionality, burning at just 4 watts, as opposed to the 30 watts upon its original installation.
